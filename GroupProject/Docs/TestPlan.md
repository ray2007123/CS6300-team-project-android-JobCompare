# Test Plan

**Author**: Team 020

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

For this project, we will implement self-testing strategies at the Unit-, Integreation- (putting the pieces together, big bang strategy), and Regression- testing level using JUnit. We will create a set of test cases for the contracts specified for each of our files and ensure high levels of line coverage. 

Unit testing is the practice of testing small pieces of code, typically individual functions, alone and isolated. We will set tests which can express each unit functions of the application.

Integration tests will test each individual contract between components, ensuring the integraity of overall system design, proper interaction of compoents, and we will run simple system-level tests. Our tests will focus on our service layer as much as possible. 

Regression testing is the repeated verification of existing tests based on unit testing and integration testing. The unit tests, integreation test, and regression tests will have some overlap. 

At the System testing level, we will detail a set of behavioral test cases, supplying inputs and examining expected outputs by hand to test the integrity of the system as a whole, and ensure the compliance with functional requirements. It will also test the non-functional property like performance testing, reliability testing, and strss testing. This will also test the contract between the service layer and the controller layer, given a sufficiently simple controller.

### 1.2 Test Selection

We will use both black-box and/or white-box techniques. 

Black box testing is simply testing as if the software itself was a black box. When doing black box testing, the only concerned would be the inputs and outputs. It either works or it doesnâ€™t. White box testing is pretty much the opposite of black box testing. With white box testing, it will generate some idea of what is going on inside the software. We will create tests that target those scenarios that supposed to be happen when using the application.

We will primarily use the category-partition method. This will allow us to thoroughly identify, characterise, and optimize the parameters. Our system level testing will be implemented using a combination of category-partition and FSM testing.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

To assess the quality of our unit, integration, and regression tests we will rely primarily on code coverage. We can rely on our IDE's coverage tool for this.

However, we will also identify key boundary conditions using the methods and verify that they have been satisfied. Our system-level testing will need to rely on our analysis from the previous section to ensure all conditions are met.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs will be tracked using the Issues tab in the repository in Github. With the growth of the project, we may choose to use another bug-tracking system such as Jira.

### 1.5 Technology

We will use JUnit for non-system testing where possible.
